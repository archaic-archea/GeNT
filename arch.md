# GeNT
This file covers the general architecture, and planned aspects of, GeNT

## Sections
GeNT is split into 3 types of sections, each section has specific use cases that allow for us to save on as much memory as possible.
The three sections are labeled the following
* Init          - Data/code only used during initialization, this memory will be released as soon as init mode is exitted
* Non-pageable  - Any data/code that is CRITICAL, and can NEVER be stored on disk while the OS is running, this code is guaranteed to always be in memory, sometimes for speed, sometimes because its required to access storage, as well as other reasons
* Pageable      - Data/Code that can be stored in... storage for later OS use, this includes some outer parts of the OS, as well as most tasks, although tasks can request that they are non-pageable
  
## Core Modules
GeNT is split up into several Core Modules, each of these serves a purpose in the OS.
* Init          - The Init core module is the same as the section specified in Sections, this is only used at the beginning, and is used for initialization. See the Init section of this document for more information
* 

## Init
The initialization process consists of starting up every Core on the system, setting up storage drivers, interrupt set up, among other system specific initialization processes.
