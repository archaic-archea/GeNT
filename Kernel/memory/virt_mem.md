# Virtual Memory
Virtual memory in GeNT is managed on a process-by-process basis, and all of them are handled the same.  When a process is started it is expected to have a stack range, a heap range, and the rest of memory can be allocated for more stack, more heap, shared memory, or for libraries. This also applies to the kernel.  
Once the scheduler is initialized, drivers will be loaded, and if they request a thread, they can be provided one by the scheduler, this means that the driver operates as a kernel level thread, the kernel is treated as a process.  
All virtual memory is managed using an implementation of Vmem, as it is good with multi-core system.
